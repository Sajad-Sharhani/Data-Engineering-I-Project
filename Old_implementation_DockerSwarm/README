## Multi-node

# Create a swarm

# docker swarm init

# Copy the command to paste in the other VMs to join the swarm as workers

# Make the network overlay

# docker network create -d overlay --attachable --opt com.docker.network.driver.mtu=1450 sparknet

# the command above is for solving the problem of the latency between the containers

# Deploy the stack

# docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my-service

## Single-node

# To start the container, run:

# docker-compose up -d

# To Enter the container, run:

# docker exec -it <spark-master-container-id> /bin/bash

# To scale the number of workers, run:

# docker-compose scale sparkwoker=<number-of-workers>

# To stop the container, run:

# docker-compose stop

# To remove the container, run:

# docker-compose rm
